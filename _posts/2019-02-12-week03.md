Our project was the Facebook "Panic Button". I wrote the scaffolding code that allowed the rest of our team to easily implement the logic for the feed hiding.
I wrote the page-unfollowing code and helped organize our project.


We managed to get feed-hiding and page unfollowing working, but couldn't make post deletion working. We suffered mostly from procrastination, difficult user flows for post deletion and a high variability in team members' comfort with JS. We did manage to get something working by the due date.

I learned how to pull from an upstream branch!
