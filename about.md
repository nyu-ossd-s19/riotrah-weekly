# Hello

My name is Rayat. I am a CS and Philo double major @ NYU, graduating in May! I tend to ramble on about Kotlin and Richard Linkater a lot and I like and I spend most of my free time making music. I want to one day be either a cloud architect or a product manager (depending on how extroverted I'm going to be in my thirties) for an open-source-first company like Red Hat or Cloudera, while balancing a band or two on the side.
